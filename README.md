# Endothelial_to_Hematopoietic_Transition
This repository contains the various analysis I conducted for my PhD thesis: single cell transcriptomical analysis of Endothelial to Hematopoietic Transition.

The study aimed to construct a comprehensive dataset exclusively from Endothelial cells from the Aorta Gonad Mesonephros regiong of E10.5 mouse embryos.

## Experimental design

![Experimental design](/images/EHT_Experimental_design.png)

Manually dissected AGMs of multiple E10.5 embryos were converted into single-cell suspensions and cryopreserved. Upon amassing a sufficient cell count, we thawed the vials and performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on two distinct experimental days.

The dataset contains 5 experimental conditions with two controls, depending on the cell labeling strategy.



## Cell labeling strategy

For correctly selecting the cells of interest

## Experimental groups

**Cdh5-Cre labelling**

Notch1 induced Deletion in Endothelial Cells -> _Notch1_<sup>iDEC</sup>

Jag1 induced Deletionn in Endothelial Cells-> _Jag1_<sup>iDEC</sup>

**Tie2-Cre labelling**

Mfng induced overexpression -> _Mfng_<sup>iOE Tie2-Cre</sup>

N1ICD induced overexpression -> _N1ICD_<sup>iOE Tie2-Cre</sup>

NMyc Loss of Function -> _NMyc_<sup>LOF Tie2-Cre</sup>
