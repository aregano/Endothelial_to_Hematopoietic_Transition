# Endothelial_to_Hematopoietic_Transition
This repository contains the various analysis I conducted for my PhD thesis: single cell transcriptomical analysis of Endothelial to Hematopoietic Transition.

The study aimed to construct a comprehensive dataset exclusively from Endothelial cells from the Aorta Gonad Mesonephros regiong of E10.5 mouse embryos.

## Experimental design



Manually dissected AGMs of multiple E10.5 embryos were converted into single-cell suspensions and cryopreserved. Upon amassing a sufficient cell count, we thawed the vials and performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on two distinct experimental days.

The dataset contains 5 experimental conditions with two controls, depending on the cell labeling strategy
